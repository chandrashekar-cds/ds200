Data sources - https://data.gov.in/resources/block-wise-coverage-individual-household-latrine-ihhl-date

Data contains the number of individual household latrines built within each block, for each district, in each state of India under swachch Bharat abhiyan.

From this data, I extracted data for state karnataka. From data of state karnataka, I extracted data for selected districts, and for district belagavi.

Scatter plot - plotted data of number of latrines for each blocks within selected districts.
 Observation - this plot gives me exact values for each block and am able to know the max and min values too.
Box plot -  plotted for each district ( with diffent values representing latrines built within each block) for a selected group of districts
  Observation - this plot helped me to know which district had max number of average latrines for each block within the district.
  
Bar plot - for each Block within district Belagavi.
  Observation - this plot helped me to know which block constructed max latrines.
